# Python-Markov-Models
Tiny python code that uses Markov models to train from texts and can then generate similar texts.

A few comments:

1. This is a very, very simple text generator, chosen mainly for how short the code is. Shouldn't be used for anything important :-)

2. The word 'order' refers to the order of the Markov model. Higher order means a better prediction but needs more training input to avoid over-training.
